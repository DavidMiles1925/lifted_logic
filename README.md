## Comments

- **Keeping it simple:** I kept this project very vanilla. I did not use any JS frameworks such as React or Angular. I felt this would better show my personal skills as a developer.

- **The slider was a fun challenge:** I had actually never done this before, so I decided to challenge myself to do this from scratch, rather than using any kind of JS library. I don't think it turned out too badly.

- **Data Validation:** The data validation I put in place was designed to demonstarte not only data validation, but also concepts of classes in OOP. I have also written a custom React hook in the past to be able to initialize data validation in just a few lines of code.
