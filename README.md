## Comments

- **Keeping it simple:** I kept this project very vanilla. I did not use any JS frameworks such as React or Angular. I felt this would better show my personal skills as a developer.

- **Data Validation:** I have written a custom hook in the past to be able to initialize data validation in forms in a signle line of code.
